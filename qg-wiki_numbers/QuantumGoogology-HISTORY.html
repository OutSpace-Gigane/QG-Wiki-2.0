    <h1>Quantum Googology History (2022 - 2025) [W.I.P / Not Completed]</h1> <br>
    <h2>December 31st, 2022:</h2> <br>
    An User called Jesse Kohn made a joke video called: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FE7N6Iv1Vc">Numbers 0 to 0</a> <br>
    CONTEXT: The Video is only shows Zero until the duration - (1:42) at the end, a text appeared which is saying "Just Kidding" <br> <br>

    <h2>June 10th, 2023:</h2> <br>
    after like 6 months an user called Circle Cube 285, started a series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4jr4ECPwFwePSDSuYYnnz6vQMWOV-zh">Numbers 0 to 0</a> <br>
    The First Part is something like mix of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SksnGJqFEhE">N0t??? PART VI from Mathis R.V.</a> + NO! BEYOND??? functions <br> <br>
    at the Same Day he sent Part 2 and he Continued that fastly.

    <h2>August 17th, 2023</h2> <br>
    an User Called JoshuaDR.0809, was started a series called "There Is No Goal" (on April 25th, 2023 [5:31 PM / 17:31]), The Series uses too much numbers especially from Quantum Googology <br>
    In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcXaRncySx0">Sneak Peek #3</a>, He used Numbers from "CC285's Numbers 0 to 0". <br> <br>

    <h2>Feburary 27th, 2024</h2> <br>
    after a few months, JoshuaDR.0809 was started a series called "Numbers 0 to 0". But The name of series caused some of negative arguments in First Part comments <br>
    after the arguments it was changed to "The Quantum Googology Journey" <br> <br>

    <h2>March 9th, 2024</h2> <br>
    an User Called "The Entrinal Pantilitol", started working on "Numbers 0 to 0", It's like CC285's one BUT the only difference is the series was going with different path. <br>
    he used: Different & Unique Functions, Apocalyptic Zero instead of Abso Zero [for Part 1] <br> <br>

    <h2>March 23rd, 2024</h2> <br>
    a BIG argument [drama in other words] happened on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EptCJthXdzI">TQGJ Part 4</a> Comments. <br> <br>
    <h3>CONTEXT (To ones that have SENSITIVE FEELINGS: Not Recommended to Read):</h3>

    Drama Was Started with a comment from Circle Cube 285: "Supi Zero = Unknown Zero" <br>
    but (According to JoshuaDR.0809) Unknown Zero was equal to Absic Zero [TQGJ Part 1] <br>
    They didn't compromise in This Scale stuff, then CC285 said (something like) this to Joshua: "You and other Meta-QG users are Banned from QG." <br>
    Joshua didn't agreed with that and Drama was continued for a while (Note From Gigane: possibly 1-2 weeks but it may longer I don't remember honestly, sorry.) <br>
    After a while, This Happened <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/joshuadr-0809s-website/quantum-googology">[CLICK_ME_TO_CHECK]</a> <br>
    <img src="../IMG/ARTICLE_QG-History.png" alt="cannot explain that long so"> <br>
    (CONTEXT: Drama was Ended.)
    <br>

    <h2>March 26th, 2024</h2> <br>
    an User Called "OutSpace Gigane", Started a Series called "Ultimate Extension of Entire Googology", and he sent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvdIU0IFAfs">SP#1</a> <br> <br>
